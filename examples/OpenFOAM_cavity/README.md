# OpenFOAM Cavity Example

## Description

This is an example of how [OpenFOAM](https://openfoam.org 'OpenFOAM')
dictionary files can be modified to build user-defined options and settings for
running Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations.
Use,

    $ optionset.py -h

to see help, or,

    $ optionset.py -a

to see the currently enabled options. Run the `Allrun` script to see the
commands that can be used to modify this case.
    
    $ ./Allrun
